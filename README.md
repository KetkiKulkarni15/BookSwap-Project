## About BookSwap
Welcome to BookSwap, where book lovers connect to exchange their favorite reads. Our mission is to make sharing books easy, fun, 
and affordable for avid readers, while promoting environmental sustainability by reducing waste through book swapping. 

## Introduction
The BookSwap project is a platform aimed at facilitating the exchange of books among users, enabling them to find, trade, or donate books within their community. 
I contributed by distributing tasks, conducting daily discussions for improvements, and gathering user feedback to enhance the platformâ€™s functionality.
Additionally, I designed the sample UI for the product using Figma and developed its website portfolio on WordPress, 
focusing on user experience and ease of navigation to promote a sustainable approach to book sharing.

## To use BookSwap, users can:
1. Sign up and create a profile.
2. Browse available books or list their own for exchange.
3. Communicate with other users to arrange swaps or donations.
